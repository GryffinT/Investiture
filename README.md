# Investiture
Source code, readme, and template for FBLA
Template: Roblox Studio and its associated assets such as:
  Textures, Lua, Parts, UI elements, Physics, VFX, SFX. As well as the Roblox Audio Library.
To play the player must:

Select the play button from the starting screen, after which the player is free to navigate the bedroom enviornment. Inside the bedroom enviornment the computer, bed, leaderboard, door, and other furniture items can be found, most of which can be interacted with or manipulated to some degree. The player must also focus on the UI elements as in they must balance their stats which can be viewed at the top of their screen. After settling into the enviornment the player can choose to sleep to recover fatigue and joy at the cost of thirst and hunger. Similarly the player can go to work to gain $67.5 at the cost of hunger, thirst, joy, and fatigue. Furthermore the player can go shopping for food which costs fatigue but restores hunger and thirst. All of which ALSO cost time as is specified on their interaction prompts. Moreover the player can use the computer, their interface into the meat of the game. On the computer the player can interface with the stock market which is only open from 8am-3pm ingame time. The player can also read the news, invest in CDs, apply for social services, and purchase furniture for their room. Finally reaching $2000 advances the player to level 2 and reaching $5000 finishes the game.
